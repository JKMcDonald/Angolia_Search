Project Feedback:
    Here in my project I was able to use the Best Buy Data from given datasets to add and index that data on Angolia's dashboard. It was simple enough to copy and paste the JSON in to the window and click save. Then I was able to select a few attributes from the index to deliver relevancy rankings in an unordered manner. 

    I Chose too display in configuration the -name, -categories, -type, and -shortDescription as the best indicators of what would bring up relevant searches if a customer were to come into my site and search for an item based on keywords and intent. I then opened up the instasearch.js github and followed instructions to build out a use case with the integrated Algolia Index. A point of feedback would be to allow users to pick img_url for the image link since it did not allow me to select it in the build process, this is why there are no images on the final screen. 

    Then I got to push my code to a GitHub repo I created and build a landing page with GitHub Pages where the website now exists. I accomplished all I intended too (Building a basic Algolia search from datasets given in the instructions with autocomplete) but I would like to play around with it some more to see if I can add styling and background images, etc...
